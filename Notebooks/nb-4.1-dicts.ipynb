    "### Working with dictionaries\n",
    "A common use case for dictionaries is for storing data when you do not know what type of labels might arise, or how many of them in total there will be in a data set. For this, a common implementation is to use a dictionary with strings for the keys and a list or integer counter for the values. This way new observed labels can be stored as dictionary keys, and values matching to those labels can be appended to the values list or increment counter. Below are  examples.   "

    "Let's create a histogram by sampling how many times a value is sampled from a normal distribution. Here, we don't know exactly which values are going to be sampled, so it is useful that we can create new dictionary keys as we continue sampling random values. The simple conditional statement asks `if key in dict` to know whether the key has already been added, if not, then a starting value is created in the `else` clause. This syntax is very commonly used. Here we create a simple counter by storing 1 the first time the key is obseverd and incrementing the value by one each time it is observed subsequently. "

    "The most useful purpose for dictionaries is the clear case where you have many values stored with different labels. An example of this that we are likely to encounter in biological data is information that we measure on individuals, populations, or species. We will eventually learn to use objects called DataFrames for storing data in labeled rows and columns, which is the way that most R users are familiar with accessing data. A dictionary is like a single row or column of a dataframe. Dictionaries are a powerful first tool for parsing data and formatting it before you later put it into a DataFrame like object for statistical analyses. "
